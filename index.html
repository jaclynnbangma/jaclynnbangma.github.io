    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="color: #ff66cc;"> I am currently attending Ruben S. Ayala High School. This is my third year in the Engineering academy. I did not know I was going to be in this academy untill the first day of school freashman year. In the 8th grade my teacher was taking role and asked who wanted to be in the academy; I had to go to the bathroom at the time and raised my hand not knowing I was being enroled in the engineering academy. That is one of the best things I have ever done in my life. Since I have been here in the academy, it has let me discover parts of me I never thought I had such as, possabilities to go to collage, advanced placement classes, great friends, and has challenged me to set higher goals.
